- Reverse and query downwards without using filter method.
- Use a related objects set. 
- Returns all child models related to parent

syntax:
parent = ParentModel.objects.get(id=2)
parent.childmodel_set.all()

customer1 = Customer.objects.get(id=2)
orders = customer1.order_set.all() <- get all order from customer 1

- we can reverse this and search on parents
syntax:
order = Order.objects.first()
print (order.customer.name) <- get the first customer that place order
